<h2>Our People</h2>

<h3>Andrey Tarantsov — CTO & co-founder</span></h3>

  <p>15 years have passed since Andrey was a proud DOS user, and he's been crazy about computer programming for all that time.</p>

</div>



<div class="column prepend-1 span-16">

  <p class="sibling">Andrey's experience ranges from GW-BASIC, through Assembler and standards-based C++ to Python, Ruby and Java. He has lead and failed his first multiperson project at the age of 16, and has learned a lot about managing software development since then. It was around the same time when he got to know that his favourite part of programming is called “object-oriented analysis and design”.</p>
  
  <p>Andrey has contributed the initial Ruby type inference code to the Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit project and has then demoed it at EclipseCon 2007. Andrey has left the DLTK team afterwards and co-founded a company which aims at creating a new generation of IDEs and productivity tools for developers.</p>
  
  <p>Currently Andrey is managing all kinds of activities the company has. He's mostly focused on Java and Eclipse world, though occasionally gets involved in Python and Ruby projects or has to apply his Win32 skills to some crazy JNIs.</p>
  
  <p>Software development is the only thing Andrey is interested in, and occasional hobbies do not attract much attention. One certain thing is that he enjoys spending his free time with his wife and 4-year old daughter.</p>

    <p><span class="hquot">“I</span> love beautiful code and beautiful designs, and I believe that every language has its own unique style which makes the definition of <span class="squots"> </span><span class="hquots">‘beautiful’</span> very different for each of them.</p>
    <p>I also love Ada, which is sharing the label of my all-time favourite language with Ruby.”</p>

<h3>Mikhail Kalugin — co-founder</h3>

  <p>Mikhail is the force pulling our most significant and important projects. He's one of those guys who learned to program before learning to write. If you hand him a new language in the morning, be prepared for black magic-powered code snippets by midnight. It's only natural that, being passionate about Macs, he's our top OS X development specialist.</p>
  
</div>
  


<div class="column prepend-1 span-16">

  <p class="sibling">Mikhail is the person behind most of DLTK Tcl plugin code and the editing features of DLTK Ruby. He also jump-started our Taskus product which is approaching a beta release soon. One thing Mikhail likes a lot is prototyping, and if you ask us for a technical demo you are likely to receive a prototype hacked together by him in a couple of days.</p>
  
  <p>His software development career starts with programmable calculators. He moved to CP/M Basic at the age of 8, gave up his personal life to Linux at 14 and knew everything from Assembler to Lisp by 16. He's currently interested in analysis and design of programming languages, and his ever-lasting passion is designing user interfaces.</p>
  
  <p>Everyone knows Mikhail as the craziest person in the company. His non-technical interests are countless, the most visible ones being mountain biking, photography, cooking and racing his MMC Lancer.</p>

    <p><span class="hquot">“A</span> bad interface somehow manages to stike my eye immediately. I'd kill most designers of washing mashines and car alarm remotes.”</p>

  <h3>Yuri Baburov — Web guru</h3>

  <p>Yuri heads our web development team. He’s been doing Python-based web development for 3 years, and is now actively exploring Ruby on Rails. Yuri is a contributor to the Django project and the maintainer of deseb — a database schema migration plugin for Django.</p>
  
  {# <p>Yuri's interests spread far besides Web. He's known to be actively interested in artificial intelligence research.</p> #}

  <h3>Leontiy Deriglazov — <span style="alt">analysis & Mac wizard</span></h3>
  
</div>



<div class="column span-6">

  <blockquote class="nomargin top bottom">
    <p><span class="hquot">“Finding</span> graceful practical solutions to tricky problems is what moves me forward.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  
</div>

<div class="column prepend-1 span-16 append-1 last">

  <p>Computer programming has been Leontiy's passion since he got his first PC in 1999. He took part in the development of Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit in 2007 and was then invited to YourSway to work on our secret static analysis framework.</p>

  <p>Besides these major projects, Leontiy had an opportunity to try POSIX-based system programming and enjoyed C++ and Python languages. Recently he decided to explore Mac OS X development world and joined one of our Objective-C projects.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="column prepend-1 span-16 append-7 last">

  <h3>Maksim Ananiev — Java master</h3>

  <p>In his career Maksim has accomplished a lot: he's been developing Eclipse plug-ins, contributing to compiler backends, developing web sites in Java and PHP. Before joining YourSway he's been working on hardware-oriented compiler optimizations for Apache Harmony project.</p>
  
  <p>Currently Maksim is primarily focused on enterprise Java developments, but we generally utilize his outstanding expertise in different areas of our consulting business.</p>

  <p>On his spare time he enjoys his conservative hobbies: horse riding, listening to jazz music and watching U.S. presidential campaigns.</p>

  <h3>Alexander Sheboltaev — Eclipse wizard</h3>

  <p>Now I’m participating in Taskus development and in refactorings determination project. I’m interested in all the programming languages stuff. I think that text representation of a code is бля-бля-бля. Считаю, что синтаксису языков уделяется слишком мало внимания и собираюсь это исправить. Программирую всё время, сколько себя помню. По-началу я и циклов-то не знал, поэтому копировал код и исправлял параметры, а строк было совсем не мало. Я прошёл через такие языки [и среды], как Basic, Visual Basic, Delphi, Pascal, C, C++, C#. Немного знаком с Assembler’ом, Smalltalk’ом, Ruby и Lisp’ом. Сейчас программирую на Java и хочу попрогать на Objective-C. Также я принял участие в разработке логотипа компании. Не так давно стал увлекаться музыкой. В частности, пою в хоре и собираюсь поступать в консерваторию.</p>
