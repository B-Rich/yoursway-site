<h2>Our People</h2>

<h3>Andrey Tarantsov — CTO & co-founder</span></h3>

  <p>15 years have passed since Andrey was a proud DOS user, and he's been crazy about computer programming for all that time.</p>

</div>



<div class="column prepend-1 span-16">

  <p class="sibling">Andrey's experience ranges from GW-BASIC, through Assembler and standards-based C++ to Python, Ruby and Java. He has lead and failed his first multiperson project at the age of 16, and has learned a lot about managing software development since then.</p>
  
  <p>Andrey has contributed the initial Ruby type inference code to the Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit project and has then demoed it at EclipseCon 2007. Andrey has left the DLTK team afterwards and co-founded a company which aims at creating a new generation of IDEs and productivity tools for developers.</p>
  
  <p>Currently Andrey is managing all kinds of activities the company has. He's mostly focused on Java and Eclipse world, though occasionally gets involved in Python and Ruby projects or has to apply his Win32 skills to some crazy JNIs.</p>
  
  <p>Software development is the only thing Andrey is interested in, and occasional hobbies do not attract much attention. One certain thing is that he enjoys spending his free time with his wife and 4-year old daughter.</p>

<h3>Mikhail Kalugin — co-founder</h3>

  <p>Mikhail is the force pulling our most significant and important projects. He's one of those guys who learned to program before learning to write. If you hand him a new language in the morning, be prepared for some black magic-powered code snippets by midnight. It's only natural that, being passionate about Macs, he's our top OS X development specialist.</p>
  
</div>
  


<div class="column prepend-1 span-16">

  <p class="sibling">Mikhail is the person behind most of DLTK Tcl plugin code and the editing features of DLTK Ruby. He also jump-started our Taskus product which is approaching a beta release soon. One thing Mikhail likes a lot is prototyping, and if you ask us for a technical demo you are likely to receive a prototype hacked together by him in a couple of days.</p>
  
  <p>His software development career starts with programmable calculators. He moved to CP/M Basic at the age of 8, gave up his personal life to Linux at 14 and had known everything from Assembler to Lisp by 16. He's currently interested in analysis and design of programming languages, and his ever-lasting passion is designing user interfaces.</p>
  
  <p>Everyone knows Mikhail as the craziest person in the company. His non-technical interests are countless, the most visible ones being mountain biking, photography, cooking and racing his MMC Lancer.</p>

  <h3>Yuri Baburov — Web guru</h3>

  <p>Yuri has been obsessed with computer science for over 14 years. The last&nbsp;5 of&nbsp;them he spent  developing Web applications and now speaks Python as his second native language.</p>

</div>

<div class="column prepend-1 span-16 append-1 last">
	
	<p class="sibling">Yuri is a believer in and contributor to the Django project. He also maintains deseb, a popular database schema migrator for Django. Now Yuri is actively exploring the world of Ruby on Rails.</p>
	
	<p>He has participated in a frightening number of different activities like developing games, building desktop applications and conducting scientific research in biocomputing. Yuri loves problems that require some creative thinking, regardless of whether that's authoring a web-based voice recognition system or debugging a huge project he has never seen before.</p>

  <h3>Leontiy Deriglazov — <span style="alt">analysis & Mac wizard</span></h3>
  
</div>



<div class="column span-6">

  <blockquote class="nomargin top bottom">
    <p><span class="hquot">“Finding</span> graceful practical solutions to tricky problems is what moves me forward.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  
</div>

<div class="column prepend-1 span-16 append-1 last">

  <p>Computer programming has been Leontiy's passion since he got his first PC in 1999. He took part in the development of Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit in 2007 and was then invited to YourSway to work on our secret static analysis framework.</p>

  <p>Besides these major projects, Leontiy had an opportunity to try POSIX-based systems programming and enjoyed C++ and Python languages. Recently he decided to explore Mac OS X development world and joined one of our Objective-C projects.</p>

  <p>He also plays wonderful organ music in the evening which everyone can enjoy thanks to our office synth.</p>

  <h3>Maksim Ananiev — enterprise wizard</h3>

  <p>Maksim has been doing a lot in his career, including Eclipse plug-ins development, contributing to compiler backends, developing web sites in Java and PHP and even adding hardware-oriented compiler optimizations to Apache Harmony, an open-source Java VM.</p>

	<p>Currently he is focused on our enterprise Java developments.</p>

  <p>Maksim also enjoys his conservative hobbies: rides a horse, listens to jazz music and watches U.S. presidential campaigns.</p>


	<h3>And the others, too</h3>
	
	<p>We must also mention our other developers — Alexander Sheboltaev and Semion Bondarev, our testing engineer Uliana Hmeliova and our sales representative Lisa Vaysman. Kudos to you, guys and girls, we'll write more of your bios soon.

  <h3>Alexander Sheboltaev — Eclipse wizard</h3>

  <p> Now I’m participating in Taskus development and in refactorings determination project. I’m interested in all the programming languages stuff. I think that text representation of a code is бля-бля-бля. Считаю, что синтаксису языков уделяется слишком мало внимания и собираюсь это исправить. Программирую всё время, сколько себя помню. По-началу я и циклов-то не знал, поэтому копировал код и исправлял параметры, а строк было совсем не мало. Я прошёл через такие языки [и среды], как Basic, Visual Basic, Delphi, Pascal, C, C++, C#. Немного знаком с Assembler’ом, Smalltalk’ом, Ruby и Lisp’ом. Сейчас программирую на Java и хочу попрогать на Objective-C. Также я принял участие в разработке логотипа компании. Не так давно стал увлекаться музыкой. В частности, пою в хоре и собираюсь поступать в консерваторию.</p>
